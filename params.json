Levenshtein distance is 0), no correction is necessary.\r\n- Otherwise, choose the word with the lowest Levenshtein distance and highest frequency.\r\n\r\n## Behavior:\r\n\r\nFor the vast majority of misspellings, the Norvig corrector and the BK Tree corrector will produce the same suggested correction. However, the behavior of the BK Tree  corrector is slightly different from the Norvig corrector because of the use of Levenshtein distance rather than edit distance. In particular, transposing letters adds 2 to the Levenshtein distance, whereas it only adds 1 to the edit distance. Thus, in the case where the Norvig corrector suggests a correction of transposing two letters for an edit distance of 1, the BK tree corrector might suggest a different correction with a Levenshtein distance of 1. For example, when [this file] (http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1342/pg1342.txt) is used as the training file, the BK Tree corrector will suggest that 'fera' be corrected to 'her'. The Norvig corrector, though, will suggest that 'fera' be corrected to 'fear'. In this case, the edit distance from 'fera' to 'fear' is 1 (transpose a and r) but the Levenshtein distance is 2. Therefore, the Norvig corrector chooses the most common word of edit distance 1 ('fear'), but the BK Tree corrector does not find any corrections of Levenshtein distance 1, so it chooses the most common word of Levenshtein distance 2 ('her').\r\n\r\n## Performance:\r\n\r\nBased on running the programs on a few different files, it appears that the\tNorvig spelling corrector goes through the training phase faster, but is slower at the correcting misspelled worse (particularly when the misspelled word is relatively long and requires going to the second level of edits in order to find a correction). The BK Tree is slower in the training phase, but faster at making corrections for misspelled words.\r\n\r\nThis would make sense because in the training phase, the Norvig corrector is simply inserting into and updating a Hashmap, while the BK Tree corrector is constructing a tree. However, in the correction phase, the Norvig corrector must first generate all possible edits and then check for them in the hashmap, whereas the BK Tree corrector traverses the tree based on the word itself without having to generate any possible edits.\r\n\t\r\n",
